Development of a professional Event Management platform  with JEE specifications (EJB3- JPA2 and JSF2) .
It's a desktop application based on JavaFX and web application connected to the same database.
in order to host an event you need to have a virtual bank account on the application which is created automatically
when  you register and  gives you a virtual wallet that you  can fill using credit-card while developing the software
